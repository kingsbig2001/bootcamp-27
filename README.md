This Repository will be housing my solutions to all the problem set in Andela Bootcamp Set 27.

aritgeo.js:
This is the Javascript solution to the AritGeo problem set
In this problem set . I will be implementing Programming Logic as well as Test Driven Development
ES6 codes are implemented here.
The use of babel is also covered here to transplint the ES6 codes to ES5 
AritGeo is meant to test if an array passed is either an Arithmetic sequence or a Geometric sequence
Conditions set here:
   case1 : making sure an arguement is passed
   case2: making sure the arguement passed is an array
   case3: making sure its not an  empty array
   case4: making sure the arrays element are data types of number only
   case5: testing for both Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence
